# Box-counting software

A collection of [SageMath](http://www.sagemath.org/) code for box-counting computations. Here
are some of the more useful objects that are implemented.

* 3d partitions (with legs)
* Fully equivariant 3-leg DT and PT vertices in cohomology and
  K-theory (checked to be equal, after normalization, up to legs of
  size 4 and 6 extra boxes)
* The elliptic Hall algebra and its Fock representation on symmetric
  polynomials.

If you are also counting boxes and would like a new feature
implemented, feel free to let me know.
